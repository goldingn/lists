# start committing into a git repo
git status (what's the current situation?)
git init (start using git in this directory and all subdirectories)
git add (stage a file - line it up to be committed next, but don't commit it)
git commit -m "message" (commit a file, with this commit message)
git log (list all the previous commits and messages)
git diff <file> (see what has changed in an unstaged file)
git diff --staged <file>  (see what has changed between a staged file and the last commit)
git reset (unstage all staged files)
git reset --hard (undo all changes to files - dangerous!!!)

# alternative commit commands
git commit -am "message" (stage and commit all files that are being tracked, with this commit message)
git commit --amend (commit any staged files and squash this commit with the last commit, using that commit's message)
git commit --amend -m "new message" (commit any staged files and squash this commit with the last commit, using this new commit message)

# go back in time
git checkout <sha> (change the tracked files back to how they were at this previous commit)
git checkout master (change the tracked files back to how they are at the most recent commit on the master branch)
git checkout HEAD~1 (change the tracked files back to how they were one commit ago)
