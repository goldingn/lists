The ELSE instructions above also work (minus the first line) to clone someone else's GitHub repository



# resolving a merge conflict
git merge <branch> (merge the branch into your current branch)
if there is a merge conflict, manually edit the files, searching files for '===' to see what needs changing, then delete the conflict markup
git add <conflicted_files> (stage the files you edited to be merged)
git merge --continue (finish the merge, using your resolution to the conflict)

# create a branch (alternate reality)
git checkout -b <local_branch> (create a new branch, splitting off from the current commit, and make that the HEAD)
git branch -v (list all current branches and their most recent commits)
git checkout <local_branch> (switch HEAD to the most recent commit on the named branch)
git branch -d <local_branch> (delete this branch - you can't delete the branch you are currently on!)
git merge <local_branch> (try to merge the branches)
