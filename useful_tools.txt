# tldr
An awesome commandline utility to provide really simple example-based helpfiles for commandline tools.
E.g. you just do:
  tldr tar
to get information about the tar command, or:
  tldr git commit
to get examples of how to use git commit

To install it you need node.js and the npm package manager (see here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/), then install tldr (see here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/tldr)


# git gr
This is a really useful alias (simple renaming of a complicated command) that I copied from stackoverflow to visualise the current state of local and remote branches
You can get it by adding the following to the .gitconfig file in your home directory:

[alias]
        gr = log --graph --full-history --all --color --pretty=tformat:"%x1b[31m%h%x09%x1b[32m%d%x1b[0m%x20%s%x20%x1b[33m(%an)%x1b[0m"
